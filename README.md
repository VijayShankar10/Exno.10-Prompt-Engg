# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

# Objective

To demonstrate how different prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, and semantic filtering—influence the quality, coherence, and structure of AI-generated content like reports, articles, case studies, and creative works.

# Prompting Techniques Overview
| Technique                      | Description                                                                          | Example Use                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Decomposition**        | Breaking a complex query into smaller, simpler sub-queries for clarity and accuracy. | Instead of “Write a detailed report on AI ethics,” ask: “1. List ethical issues in AI. 2. Explain one issue in detail. 3. Suggest solutions.” |
| **Decision-Making Prompts**    | Asking the model to choose among alternatives or justify choices.                    | “Compare CNN and RNN for text classification and recommend the best one with reasons.”                                                        |
| **Semantic Filtering**         | Guiding the model to focus on certain meanings, tones, or content scopes.            | “Write a news article about renewable energy using a neutral and factual tone.”                                                               |
| **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** | Asking the model to reason step-by-step before answering.                            | “Think step by step: How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?”                                                        |
| **Role Prompting**             | Assigning a specific persona or role to improve style/accuracy.                      | “Act as a data scientist writing a project summary for non-technical stakeholders.”                                                           |
| **Few-shot Prompting**         | Providing examples to guide the model’s output style or logic.                       | “Example 1: … Example 2: … Now write a similar paragraph on robotics.”                                                                        |

# Demonstration Setup
# Example:
# Topic: AI in Healthcare
| Content Type    | Prompting Technique                 | Example Prompt                                                                                                 | Expected Output                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Report**      | Query Decomposition                 | “1. Explain how AI is used in diagnostics. 2. Describe benefits. 3. Mention limitations.”                      | Structured, factual report with clear sections.   |
| **Article**     | Decision-Making                     | “Should AI replace doctors in diagnostics? Write an opinion article with pros and cons.”                       | Persuasive, balanced article.                     |
| **Case Study**  | Semantic Filtering + Role Prompting | “As a healthcare analyst, write a case study on AI-driven radiology systems, focusing on ethics and accuracy.” | Formal, professional tone focusing on key issues. |
| **Comic Story** | Chain-of-Thought + Few-shot         | “Create a 3-panel comic script about a robot nurse learning empathy. Follow the style of the given example.”   | Creative, narrative-driven output.                |

# Evaluation Criteria:
After generating outputs, evaluate them using:
| Criterion      | Description                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Coherence**  | Is the text logically organized and consistent?                          |
| **Relevance**  | Does the output directly address the topic and avoid irrelevant details? |
| **Creativity** | For creative works, is the content original and engaging?                |
| **Clarity**    | Is the writing easy to understand?                                       |
| **Depth**      | Does it demonstrate reasoning or just surface-level facts?               |

# Analysis Section:
Discuss how prompt structure affected:

Depth of reasoning

Factual accuracy

Tone and creativity

Length and structure of responses

Model’s ability to stay on topic

# Example finding:

Query decomposition produced the most coherent and detailed reports, while role prompting improved tone consistency in professional documents. Chain-of-thought prompting enhanced reasoning but sometimes increased verbosity.

# Presentation Ideas:
To make your demonstration engaging:

Use side-by-side examples of different outputs.

Highlight differences in structure using color or annotations.

Include a reflection slide or report section on how prompt engineering can optimize AI collaboration.
# Result :  The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
